        <p>If wishes could turn to realities, I would fling down my law books, and sup with you to-night. But, alas, here am I doomed to fix, while you are fluttering from city to city, and enjoying all the pleasures which a gay climate can afford. It is out of the power of my heart to envy your good fortune, yet I cannot help indulging a few natural desires; as for example, to take a walk with you on the banks of the <placeName ref="#rhone">Rhône</placeName>, and to be climbing up <placeName ref="#mountfourviere">mount Fourviere</placeName>;</p>
        <lg>
          <l>Jam mens prætrepidans avet vagari:</l>
          <l>Jam læti studio pedes vigescunt.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>However, so long as I am not deprived of your correspondence, so long shall I always find some pleasure in being at home. And, setting all vain curiosity aside, when the fit is over, and my reason begins to come to herself, I have several other powerful motives which might easily cure me of my restless inclinations: Amongst these, my <persName ref="#mother">Mother</persName>'s ill state of health is not the least; which was the reason of our going to <placeName ref="#tunbridge">Tunbridge</placeName>, so that you cannot expect much description or amusement from thence. Nor indeed is there much room for either; for all diversions there may be reduced to two articles, gaming and going to church. They were pleased to publish certain <title>Tunbrigiana</title> this season; but such ana! I believe there were never so many vile little verses put together before. So much for <placeName ref="#tunbridge">Tunbridge</placeName>: <placeName ref="#london">London</placeName> affords me as little to say. What! so huge a town as <placeName ref="#london">London</placeName>? Yes, consider only how I live in that town. I never go into the gay or high world, and consequently receive nothing from thence to brighten my imagination. The busy world I leave to the busy; and am resolved never to talk politics till I can act at the same time. To tell old stories, or prate of old books, seems a little musty; and <quote>toujours Chapon bouilli</quote>, won't do. However, for want of better fare, take another little mouthful of my poetry.</p>

          <l>Fallere curas:</l>
